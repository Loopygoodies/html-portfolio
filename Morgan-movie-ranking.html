<h1>My Favorite Movies List</h1>
<h2>Listed as most favorite to least favorite</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. Sweeney Todd</h3>
<p>You can't go wrong with a musical about sweet revenge, said the Scorpio. PLus Helena Bohem's tits are out for basically the whole time.</p>
<h3>2. Lord Of the Rings</h3>
<p>A cult classic. It's nostalgic, it's magical, it's a great escape from reality. Also Liv Tyler and Cate fucking Blanchett, need I say more?</p>
<h3>3. Step Brothers</h3>
<p>Now for some comedic relief, we have Step Brothers. The hilarious ridiculousness duo of Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly is like none other. </p>
